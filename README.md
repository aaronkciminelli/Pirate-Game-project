## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

When approaching a problem, I typically start by analyzing the problem, understanding its requirements, and identifying potential solutions. I then develop an algorithm or model, implement it using a programming language, and test its performance. If necessary, I iterate on the solution, refining and optimizing it until it meets the desired goals.

I implemented the training loop for the Q-learning algorithm in the Intelligent Pirate Game project. I started by randomly selecting a free cell for the agent, resetting the maze with the agent at the chosen position, and initializing the environment state. I then implemented an exploration-exploitation strategy for the agent to choose actions, where the agent either explores by choosing random actions or exploits by selecting actions based on predicted Q-values. After each action, I updated the environment state, stored the episode in the experience replay object, and trained the neural network model. I also evaluated the loss, kept track of wins, and calculated the win rate for each epoch.

As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities to ensure the privacy and security of user data, provide accurate and unbiased information, and consider the potential consequences of the technology I create. I should be transparent about the limitations of my solutions and be committed to addressing any unintended consequences. Additionally, I must adhere to the organization's policies and follow industry best practices to maintain the trust of end users and stakeholders.
